sip-demo project:
	this project from a chinese book named: 
		<Linux网络编程>
		2010年1月清华大学出版社出版的图书, 作者是宋敬彬、孙海滨;

	maybe it's another shit project, i can see there is no any usage info for this project,
	so if you are not good at udp/sip programming, i'm pretty sure that you can not handle this project;
	if you are a student and you want to learn udp/sip programming,
	then be careful, this project error is not corrected yet.
	(if i have more free time, i'll do this for you, but, leave it to next time when i got some free time okay?)

	this project is not finished yet, only passed the compile program;
	i dont figure it out how to use it,
	i dont fixed all the c codes bug,
	i dont figure it out how this program logic running
	so, this project unfinished yet



	also another bullshit, this whole project is a f***ing bullshit !!
	this project is a eth hardware network programming, 
	it's not sip protocol programming for video/audio realtime media stream program,
	f*** this guys, asshole !!

	another project named sipfw, it's also not a sip firewall program project, it's a normal kernel tcp/ip firewall project, 
	completely diff things between of sip protocol programming for video/audio realtime media stream program;
	f*** all this people, asshole !!
